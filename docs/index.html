    <h4>Why This Investigation Matters</h4>
    <p>KT/Kayte's role in the revival of Doxbin raises significant questions about the motivations behind their actions. The platform has a controversial history, and understanding why KT/Kayte has chosen to associate with it is crucial. This investigation seeks to uncover the truth behind their claims and the implications of their actions, without focusing on their identity or the platform's existence.</p>
    
    <p>As we delve deeper into the history of Doxbin, we must consider the ethical implications of doxing and the potential harm it can cause to individuals whose information is exposed. The revival of such a platform under KT/Kayte's leadership could indicate a troubling trend in the online community, where personal information is weaponized for various purposes.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>The History of Doxbin</h2>
    <p>Doxbin was originally launched in 2011 as a .onion service on the Tor network. It became known for hosting sensitive personal information, making it a target for law enforcement. The site was seized during Operation Onymous in 2014 but was revived in 2019 by Brenton.</p>

    <p>During its initial run, Doxbin became infamous for allowing users to post personal information about others without consent, leading to severe consequences for many individuals. The site's unchecked spread of private information made it a focal point for discussions about privacy, ethics, and the responsibilities of online platforms.</p>

    <h2>New Information on KT/Kayte</h2>
    <p>Recent findings suggest that KT/Kayte, now known as Poorskid, has a complex history tied to the Doxbin platform. Here are some key points:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>There are claims that the original Doxbin was created by an individual known as Drugz before KT took over. <img src="https://r2.interrupted.me/F/kwbGzeaU.webp" alt="Ryan describing Drugz"></li>
        <li>The KT stated that it was made in May of 2018, however, the site says different. <img src="https://r2.interrupted.me/F/4pCkQtbl.webp" alt="Doxbin site information"></li>
        <li>Domain registration records indicate that doxbin.org was registered in 2016, modified in 2017, and expired in 2018.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Evidence of Domain Registration</h2>
    <p>According to Ryan from Lizard Squad, the original registration for doxbin.org was from November 21, 2016, to November 21, 2018. This information is crucial in understanding the timeline of Doxbin's ownership and the potential motivations behind KT/Kayte's actions.</p>

    <h2>Implications of Doxbin's Revival</h2>
    <p>The revival of Doxbin under KT/Kayte's leadership raises concerns about the potential for increased doxing activities. With the rise of online harassment and the weaponization of personal information, it is essential to scrutinize the motivations behind such platforms. Are they merely providing a service, or are they contributing to a culture of harm?</p>

    <p>Furthermore, the ethical considerations surrounding the revival of Doxbin cannot be overlooked. The platform's history is marred by instances of abuse, and its return could signal a troubling trend in the online community. As we continue this investigation, we aim to shed light on these issues and hold those responsible accountable.</p>
